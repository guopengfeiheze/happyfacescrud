#summary Quick startup guide

= Start a project =

  * Download archetype-1.0.0-beta.rar from downloads section
  * Unrar it.
  * Enter archetype dir and run "mvn install".
  * After archetype is in your local repository go to project workspace (must leave archetype dir where pom is) and run "mvn archetype:generate !-DarchetypeCatalog=local" to create your project from happyfaces archetype.
  * Import it to eclipse (TODO not tested on other IDEs - feedback would be really appreciated). Use M2E plugin and add maven nature (NOT mvn eclipse:eclipse).
  * Right click on project choose maven -> update project configuration.
  * Edit build.properties file and fill information about your database. Mysql is recommended and its connector is included in maven pom, but of course any other database can be used.
  * Add project to tomcat and start.
  * Go to http://localhost:8080/{project name}/login.jsf and enter User/Passw admin/admin.
  * Browse simple sample application and then check how it is implemented. Code is self explanatory and easy to understand, just play around.
  * Go learn more (TODO more documentation).
  * Feedback is really welcome!
